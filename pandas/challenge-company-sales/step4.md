### Step 4: Visualizing the data

In this step, you will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create some visualizations of the sales data.

#### Requirements:

Visualize the total sales by location, product code, and day using functions called `visualize_sales_by_location()`, `visualize_sales_by_product()`, and `visualize_sales_by_day()`, respectively. Each function takes in two arguments, the input file name and the output file name for the visualization. The output file will contain the visualization.
