# Step 1 Loading and inspecting the data:

In this step, you will load the data from a CSV file using Pandas, and then inspect the data to get an understanding of its structure and content.

## Requirements:

Read in the data from the input file and write the first 5 rows to a CSV file using `read_data_head()`. The function takes in two arguments, the input file name and the output file name for the first 5 rows. The output file will contain the first 5 rows of the input file.

## Example Output
