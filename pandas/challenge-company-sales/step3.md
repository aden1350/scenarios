# Step 3 Grouping and Aggregating the data

In this step, you will use Pandas to group the data by different variables and compute some aggregate statistics.

## Requirements

Calculate total sales by location, product code, and day using `sales_by_location()`, `sales_by_product()`, and `sales_by_day()`, respectively. Each function takes in two arguments, the input file name and the output file name for the calculated data. The output file will contain the calculated data.

## Example Output

   location  price
0    Boston    450
1     Miami    600
2  New York    300
  product_code  price
0            A    300
1            B    450
2            C    600
         date  price
0  2022-01-01    450
1  2022-01-02    450
2  2022-01-03    450
